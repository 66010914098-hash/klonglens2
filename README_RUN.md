# Run Instructions (klonglens2)

There are **two** easy ways to run this project:

## A) Run directly in your browser (recommended for quick preview)
1. Double‑click **index.html** (or open it via VS Code Live Server).
2. That's it — it's a pure front‑end site.  
   If any features need localStorage or navigation, use a local server (option B).

## B) Run with Node.js static server (fixes the `document is not defined` confusion)
> The error happened because `main.js` is **browser code** — it must run in a web page, not in Node.
> I've added a minimal server so you can run the site properly with Node.

1. Install **Node.js 18+**.
2. Open a terminal in this folder and run:
   ```bash
   node server.js
   # or: npm start
   ```
3. Open **http://localhost:8080** in your browser.

### What I changed
- **main.js**: added a safety guard so if someone runs it in Node by mistake, it won't crash with `document is not defined`.
- Added **server.js** and **package.json** to serve the site without any external dependencies.
- Kept your original file structure and links intact.

If you want to change the port:
```bash
PORT=3000 node server.js
```
